CBGP is an efficient BGP decision process simulator. The BGP mod-
el implemented in CBGP is not hindered by the transmission of BGP
messages  on  simulated  TCP connections as in SSFNet or JavaSim.
The simulator supports the complete BGP decision process,  import
and  export  filters and redistribution communities. It is easily
configurable through a CISCO-like  command-line  interface.  CBGP
does not model session establishment and timers (MRAI, dampening,
...)

CBGP can be used to experiment with modified  decision  processes
and  additional  BGP  attributes. It can also be used to evaluate
the impact of input/output policies on the routing tables of oth-
er ASes. Due to its efficiency, it can be used with large topolo-
gies with sizes of the same order of magnitude than the Internet.

CBGP is open source and written in C language. It has been tested
on various platforms like Linux, FreeBSD  and  Solaris.  To  make
large  simulations  easier  to perform, CBGP is also able to load
interdomain topologies produced by AT&T and is also able to  out-
put  all the exchanged BGP messages in MRTD format so that exist-
ing analysis scripts may be re-used.
