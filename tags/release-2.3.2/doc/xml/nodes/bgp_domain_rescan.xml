  <abstract>re-scan the BGP routes for changes</abstract>
  <description>
<p>
This command re-scans the BGP routes held by all the routers in the specified domain. It looks for changes in the routing state that would need that the BGP decision process be re-run. Examples of such changes are: change in the availability of IGP routes or change in the IGP metrics. If any change is detected, the decision process is re-run for the concerned prefixes. New events are therefore queued and the <cmd><name>sim run</name><link>sim_run</link></cmd> command should be called.

Note that calling this command is equivalent to calling the <cmd><name>bgp router rescan</name><link>bgp_router_rescan</link></cmd> command individually for each router in the domain.
