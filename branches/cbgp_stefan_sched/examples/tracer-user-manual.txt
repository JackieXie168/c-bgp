The main steps are :
1 - set the system (topology and policies)
2 - open the bgp sessions (this makes cbgp simulate the "bgp open session" messages exchange)
3 - use the tracer in manual or automated mode


1 - Set the system : 
    This is done the same way as the original cbgp

2 - In order to open the bgp sessions, use the new command :
    cbgp> sim openSessions
    This makes cbgp simulate every "bgp open session" messages

3A - Automated Mode :
    The behavior of the only automated mode is to trace the whole graph (with a limited depth fixed in the source code).
    cbgp> tracer trace whole_graph

3B - Manual Mode :
    The manual mode allows to direct the graph building.
