  <description>
<p>
This command configures the route filters of the BGP sessions according to business policies specified in the loaded AS-level topology (see <cmd><name>bgp topology load</name><link>bgp_topology_load</link></cmd>).
</p>
<p>
The filters are composed of two parts. The first part enforces the <i>valley-free</i> property. The second part enforces a preference for routes depending on the type of neighbor they are received from. Routes from customers receive the highest preference, followed by routes received from shared-cost peers and finally, routes received from providers are the less preferred. The filters are implemented using the LOCAL-PREF and COMMUNITIES.
