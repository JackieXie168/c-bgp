<p>
This command adds a tunnel from one node towards the tunnel <arg>end-point</arg>. The tunnel end-point should be another existing node (though <i>C-BGP</i> will not perform any verification). Messages that will be routed through this tunnel will be encapsulated in a packet whose destination is the <arg>end-point</arg> address. Such packets will therefore be forwarded to the <arg>end-point</arg> and decapsulated there. See also the <cmd><name>net node ipip-enable</name><link>net_node_ipip-enable</link></cmd> command to enable the decapsulation of IP-in-IP paquets at the tunnel end-point.

<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE: due to changes in the network topology data structure, the tunneling feature is currently broken.
