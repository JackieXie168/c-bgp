  <abstract>activate soft-restart on a BGP session</abstract>
  <description>
<p>
This command activates "soft-restart" on a virtual peer. Soft-restart allows virtual peers to keep their routes when their session is teared down.
</p>
<p>
Since the routes available to virtual peers are learned through the <cmd><name>bgp router peer recv</name><link>bgp_router_peer_recv</link></cmd> command, they are lost when the session with the virtual peer is teared down. With the soft-restart option, the Adj-RIB-in corresponding to the virtual peer is not cleared when the session is teared down. These routes are therefore still available upon session restart.
