  <description>
<p>This command can be used to obtain details about the outcome of the decision process for a single destination or for all destinations. The destination can be specified as a prefix to perform an exact-match search in the router RIB, as an address to perform a best-match search or with a wildcard (*) if all destinations are requested.</p>
<p>Here is an example output for this command. A wildcard has been used to request information about all known destinations. There are only 3 routes in the example. For each destination prefix, the decision process rule which made the final tie-break is displayed. The number of routes available for this prefix is also shown. In the example, the router knows a single route for the 2nd and 3rd prefixes. For this reason, no decision process rule is shown, but the message "Single choice" is displayed instead.
