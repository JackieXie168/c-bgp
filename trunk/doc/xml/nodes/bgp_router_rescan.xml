  <abstract>re-scan the BGP routes for changes</abstract>
  <description>
<p>
This command is used to rescan the BGP routes contained in one BGP router. This command must be used after changes in static and IGP routes that could cause changes in the outcome of the decision process.
</p>
<p>
The command works as follows. First it builds the list of all BGP prefixes known by the router. Then, for each prefix, it checks if the selection of the best route towards this prefix depends on the state of static or IGP routes. If so, the decision process for this prefix is re-run.
