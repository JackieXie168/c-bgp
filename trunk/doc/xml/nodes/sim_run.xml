<p>
This command starts the simulator, i.e. it starts processing the queued events until no more event is available or the simulator is stopped.

Instead of processing all the events until the simulator's pending events set is empty, it is also possible to process one event at a time or a limited number of events at a time. To do this, use command <cmd><name>sim step</name><link>sim_step</link></cmd>.
